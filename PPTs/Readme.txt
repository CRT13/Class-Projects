This section consists of class presentations (PPTs) I've made in recent years, uploaded as PDF files.
There's no good reason to put these up here, than to have them for my own reference.
Anyway, if these come in handy as templates for school/college students, I'd be glad.

Note:
Currently only BE-4th_Year PPTs have been uploaded.
